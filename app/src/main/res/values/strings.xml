    <string name="app.premium.description">Opting for the Premium subscription allows you to jump ahead in the line, much like a custom API key with high kudos amount does.\n\nWhat essentially happens is this: instead of being grouped with the default, anonymous API key users, you join a higher tier with a considerable amount of kudos, thereby gaining queue priority.\n\nThe benefits of this include:\n- High priority in the queue (equivalent to providing your own api key with high amount of kudos)\n- The ability to set more complex generation parameters (as is possible with any API key, even without kudos)\n- Your support contributes directly to the continuing development of the app\n\nPlease note that the premium subscription doesn\'t provide:\n- Exclusive access to special features\n- Improved image quality above what is usual without a premium subscription\n\nSimply put, a Premium package isn\'t necessary unless you want faster response times during peak hours. If you still decide to subscribe, knowing these conditions, we sincerely appreciate it!</string>

    <string name="app.title.help">Help</string>
    <string name="app.help.prompt_description">Prompt describes what you want to see in the image. Use keywords separated by comma. For example, to get an abstract image of a woman, you can use: woman, abstract, art, colorful</string>
    <string name="app.help.negative_prompt_description">Negative prompt describes what you don\'t want to see in the image. The format is the same as in Prompt, to complement the prompt example, you might add \"realistic, ugly, deformed\" as a negative prompt to ensure you get some nice abstract image.</string>
    <string name="app.help.model_description">Model determines what the image will look like. Each model has different style and the only way to know what you like is to either try it out or search for the model on the internet. Some good starting models include: Lyriel (for artistic images), I Can\'t Believe It\'s Not Photography (realistic images), AlbedoBase XL (general model that has no specialization)</string>
    <string name="app.help.sampler_description">Sampler is what\'s responsible for the technical process of generating an image. There\'s not really a universal sampler that\'s best in all cases, you might want to experiment a bit. If you don\'t want to, k_dpmpp_sde or k_dpmpp_2m is a good start.</string>
    <string name="app.help.steps">Steps</string>
    <string name="app.help.steps_description">Each step the image is generated based on your prompt and the image generated in previous step, meaning after each step the AI tries to make the image more like what you describe in your prompt. Note that it will eventually go overboard and make the image worse than the previous one, that\'s why more steps doesn\'t necessarily mean better. The sweet spot is usually between 20 and 60.</string>
    <string name="app.help.clip_skip">CLIP skip</string>
    <string name="app.help.clip_skip_description">CLIP is a neural network that\'s in charge of converting your prompt from text to a numerical representation that the image generator then understands. The neural network is made of layers and this setting allows you to skip some of them and feed the numerical representation of your prompt to the image generating process earlier. In simple terms, this changes how the AI sees your prompt without actually changing the prompt. Vastly different results might be produced depending on the model and the value you set here. Usually 1 or 2 is a good value, but feel free to experiment.</string>
    <string name="app.help.width_height_description">Width and height, perhaps unsurprisingly, control the dimensions of your image. All values must be divisible by 64. Note that most models are either trained on 512x512 or 1024x1024 images, so any other dimension might have some caveats. Generally speaking, both dimensions should be 1024 or less if you want consistently good resulst. Going above 2048 rarely makes sense and the pool of workers able to take on your request goes down with higher resolutions. Feel free to experiment to see which dimensions look good. Note that the values here are not necessarily the target dimensions, as an Upscaler that makes the image larger can be used afterwards. In fact, the default values calculate the ratio between your width and height and set the larger side to 1024, afterwards an upscaler is used to enlarge the image either 2x or 4x based on your resolution.</string>
    <string name="app.help.upscaler_description">Upscaler is a model that enlarges your image after it has been generated. Every Upscaler uses a different algorithm to do so, so the resulting image might look slightly differently, try out which one looks the best for you. If you specify an Upscaler, your image is first generated at the resolution you specify and afterwards enlarged by your selected Upscaler. By default, either RealESRGAN_x4plus or RealESRGAN_x2plus is used depending on your resolution.</string>
